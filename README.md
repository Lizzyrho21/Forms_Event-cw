### JavaScript Events

- **Why**
  - Events provide a dynamic interface to a webpage.
- **What**
  - Events are actions or occurances that happen to HTML elements. JavaScript code can then be written to react to these events.
- **How**
  - Start with a basic demonstration of an event and event listeners on a `<div>` element in CodePen or VSCode.
  - Break down the steps with event handling:
    - Grab element to listen to.
    - Add `addEventListener()` method and pass in the 2 arguments of the event type and callback/event handler function.
    - Build out the event handler function. You can demonstrate this as an inline anonymous function or a separately defined callback function.
